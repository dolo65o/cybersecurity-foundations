## Port forwarding

Port forwarding is an essential component in connecting applications and services to the Internet. Without port forwarding, applications and services such as web servers are only available to devices within the same direct network.
> Port forwarding is configured at the router of a network.


## Firewall

A security tool, hardware or software that is used to filter network traffic by stopping unauthorized incoming and outgoing traffic.

- Firewalls can be categorised into 2 to 5 categories.
- Two primary categories of firewalls :-
    - Stateful :- This type of firewall uses the entire information from a connection, this firewall determines the behaviour of a device based upon the entire connection.
    - Stateless :- This firewall type uses a static set of rules to determine whether or not individual packets are acceptable or not.these firewalls are great when receiving large amounts of traffic from a set of hosts (such as a Distributed Denial-of-Service attack)

 
## Virtual Private Network (VPN)

A Virtual Private Network is a way to create a secure "tunnel" between two networks.

* VPN technology has improved over the years,some listed:-
   - `PPP`  :- This technology is used by PPTP (explained below) to allow for authentication and provide encryption of data.
   - `PPTP` :- The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is the technology that allows the data from PPP to travel and leave a network.
   - `IPSec`:- Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) encrypts data using the existing Internet Protocol (IP) framework.
