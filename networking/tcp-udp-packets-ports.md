## Packets & Frames

* Packets and frames are small pieces of data that, when forming together, make a larger piece of information or message.
* A packet is a piece of data from Layer 3 (Network Layer) of the OSI model, containing information such as an IP header and payload. A frame, however, is used at Layer 2 (Data Link) of the OSI model.

## TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a connection-oriented protocol requiring a TCP three-way-handshake to establish a connection. TCP provides reliable data transfer, flow control and congestion control. Higher-level protocols such as HTTP, POP3, IMAP and SMTP use TCP

The TCP/IP protocol consists of four layers:-

- Application
- Transport
- Internet
- Network Interface
